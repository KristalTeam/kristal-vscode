# Kristal Extension

Provides better support for [Kristal](https://kristal.cc/) modding using [sumneko's Lua Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) extension.

## Features

Conveniently provides code documentation for Kristal mods without much setup.

You will be asked if you'd like to use the Kristal environment if you have one of these files in your workspace:
- `mod.lua`
- `lib.lua`
